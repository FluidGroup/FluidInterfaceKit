# ``FluidInterfaceKit``

**FluidInterfaceKit** provides the advanced infrastructure for your iPhone apps.

Built on top of UIKit, replace UIKit standard transitions with the custom components.

It provides components that make your app more flexible - interactive and interruptible transition, free to unwind view controllers without `pop` or `dismiss`.

That would fit to create fully customized UI apps such as Snapchat, Zenly, Uber, Instagram Threads.

FluidInterfaceKit's essential component is `FluidStackController`, which stacks view controllers with customized transitions.

Apps run with this component, only stacking but it can get flexibility instead.
