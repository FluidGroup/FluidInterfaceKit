# FluidStack

**FluidStack** provides the advanced infrastructure for your iPhone apps.  

Built on top of UIKit, replace UIKit standard transitions with the custom components.

It provides components that make your app more flexible - interactive and interruptible transition, free to unwind view controllers without `pop` or `dismiss`.

That would fit to create fully customized UI apps such as Snapchat, Zenly, Uber, Instagram Threads.

FluidInterfaceKit's essential component is `FluidStackController`, which stacks view controllers with customized transitions.

Apps run with this component, only stacking but it can get flexibility instead.

> üíî
> Please take care of the risks to using this framework; the meaning of using this detaches from Apple's UIKit ecosystem.
For instance: the history menu of the back bar button, page-sheet modal, and accessibility.
> This framework tries to follow the updates of UIKit as long as.

# Structure of App with FluidStack

<img width="882" alt="CleanShot 2022-02-13 at 01 55 46@2x" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1888355/153720497-91eff2cc-890c-4b7b-b194-ab558c82829a.png">

# Motivation

Normally, UIKit allows us to get screen management with `UIViewController.present`, `UIViewController.dismiss`, `UINavigationController.push`, `UINavigationController.pop`.

In the case of a view controller that needs to display on modal and navigation, that view controller requires to support both.  
In modal, what if it uses `navigationItem`, should be wrapped with `UINavigationController` to display.

Moreover, that view controller would consider how to dismiss itself unless handled by outside.  
Pop or dismiss which depends on the context.

**FluidInterfaceKit** provides `FluidStackController`, which is similar to `UINavigationController`.
It offers all of the view controllers that are managed in stacking as a child of the stack.

Try to think of it with what if we're using `UINavigationController`.  
All view controllers will display on that, and push to the next view controller, what if needed nesting, push another UINavigationController.  
Expression of transition would not be a problem, we can create a custom transition, so it can be like a modal presentation - slide in from the bottom.

If the app runs like that, we only use `push` and `pop` to manage screens except for the special case of using `present` - UIAlertController or other modals in third-party libraries.
Still, modals work very well since nobody use presentation.

As above mentioned, `FluidStackController` is similar to `UINavigationController`, it just stacks view controllers that are managed as a child.  
What difference with `UINavigationController` is **transitions**, it provides interfaces to create custom transition and it supports more flexibility.

Custom transitions that run with `UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning` have some limitations in modal-presentation and push-transition.  
It supports cancellation, which would be a part of flexibility, but it's not enough.

Please see what happens in iOS Home Screen, it supports completely responding to user interaction - opening an app, canceling opening by Home bar, moving back the home, then opening the app again by touch.

# Setting up your app

**ExampleApp** in this project shows how setting up.  
**FluidInterfaceKit-Demo** shows a lot of examples.

First of all, you need to put a `FluidStackController` in a root view controller for a `UIWindow`.

In Storyboard based app, set the entry pointed view controller as `FluidStackController` or subclass of it.  
In Code based app, set a root view controller of `UIWindow` as `FluidStackController` or subclass of it.  

**`didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` in AppDelegate**
```swift
let newWindow = UIWindow()
       
newWindow.rootViewController = RootViewController()
newWindow.makeKeyAndVisible()
    
window = newWindow
```

**RootViewController**
```swift
final class RootViewController: FluidViewController {
 
  override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    
    view.backgroundColor = .systemBackground
    
    // üìç
    addContentViewController(FirstViewController(), transition: .disabled)
  }
}
```

**FirstViewController**

```swift
final class FirstViewController: FluidViewController {
    
  func runSomething() {
    fluidPush(SecondViewController(), target: .current, relation: .hierarchicalNavigation)
  }
}
```

**SecondViewController**

To dismiss itself, call `fluidPop()`

## FluidGesture

![CleanShot 2024-03-29 at 04 11 57](https://github.com/FluidGroup/FluidInterfaceKit/assets/1888355/46087985-a052-4c87-b5ef-d5d0061b1ef9)

Making a view can be draggable in an easier way.  
Supports dragging finished animation with moving another position respecting gesture's velocity using spring animation.  
Rubber banding effect is built-in.

```swift
let draggableView: UIView

draggableView.makeDraggable(
  descriptor: .init(
    horizontal: .init(min: -200, max: 200, bandLength: 30),
    vertical: .init(min: -200, max: 200, bandLength: 30),
    handler: .init(
      onStartDragging: {

      },
      onEndDragging: { velocity, offset, contentSize in
        // return proposed offset to finish dragging
        return .init(width: 0, height: 0)
      }
    )
  )
)
```
