# FluidInterfaceKit - Components library that makes apps more flexible.

[![Build](https://github.com/muukii/FluidInterfaceKit/actions/workflows/Build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/muukii/FluidInterfaceKit/actions/workflows/Build.yml)

## Overview

**FluidInterfaceKit** provides the advanced infrastructure for your iPhone apps.  

Built on top of UIKit, replace UIKit standard transitions with the custom components.

It provides components that make your app more flexible - interactive and interruptible transition, free to unwind view controllers without `pop` or `dismiss`.

That would fit to create fully customized UI apps such as Snapchat, Zenly, Uber, Instagram Threads.

FluidInterfaceKit's essential component is `FluidStackController`, which stacks view controllers with customized transitions.

Apps run with this component, only stacking but it can get flexibility instead.

> Please take care of the risks to using this framework; the meaning of using this detaches from Apple's UIKit eco-system.
For instance: the history menu of the back bar button, page-sheet modal, and accessibility.
> This framework tries to follow the updates of UIKit as long as.

## Motivation

Normally, UIKit offers us to get screen management with `UIViewController.present`, `UIViewController.dismiss`, `UINavigationController.push`, `UINavigationController.pop`.

In the case of a view controller that needs to display on modal and navigation, that view controller requires to supports both.  
In modal, what if it uses `navigationItem`, should be wrapped with `UINavigationController` to display.

Moreover, that view controller would consider how to dismiss itself unless handled by outside.  
Pop or dismiss which depends on the context.

**FluidInterfaceKit** provides `FluidStackController`, which is similar to `UINavigationController`.
It offers all of the view controllers that are managed in stacking as a child of the stack.

Try to think of it with what if we're using `UINavigationController`.  
All view controllers will display on that, and push to the next view controller, what if needed nesting, push another UINavigationController.  
Expression of transition would not be a problem, we can create a custom transition, so it can be like a modal presentation - slide in from the bottom.

If the app runs like that, we only use `push` and `pop` to manage screens except for the special case of using `present` - UIAlertController or other modals in third-party libraries.
Still, modals work very well since nobody use presentation.

As above mentioned, `FluidStackController` is similar to `UINavigationController`, it just stacks view controllers that are managed as a child.  
What difference with `UINavigationController` is **transitions**, it provides interfaces to create custom transition and it supports more flexibility.

Custom transitions that run with `UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning` have some limitations in modal-presentation and push-transition.  
It supports cancellation, which would be a part of flexibility, but it's not enough.

Please see what happens in iOS Home Screen, it supports completely responding to user interaction - opening an app, canceling opening by Home bar, moving back the home, then opening the app again by touch.
